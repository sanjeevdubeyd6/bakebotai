                Sativa: Sativa Cannabis is a strain of cannabis that has a characteristic uplifting and energizing effect. It is very versatile as you can use it to treat multiple medical conditions, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, migraines, and chronic pain.
                Indica: Indica Cannabis is a type of cannabis typically used because it creates feelings of sleepiness and sedation. It also has a higher level of CBD, which is often used to alleviate certain medical conditions. However, you should note that a higher CBD level doesn't necessarily mean less THC.
                Hybrid: This type is a mixture of the two previous ones and tends to balance the euphoric feelings of Sativa with the mellow sense of Indica.
